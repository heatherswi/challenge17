        Cannoli, a handsome Siamese mix kitten, was born on Mission Street in San Antonio’s King William
        neighborhood in San Antonio in spring 2009. He was adopted by Nancy S. Diehl, who was inspired by Cannoli
        and went on to become a co-founder and President of the Cannoli Fund in order to help more cats and dogs
        like him. <br></br> After an illness, Cannoli sadly passed away in 2013, but his memory and legacy will
        continue through The Cannoli Fund that he helped to inspire.

          <div class="nancy">
            <h2>President - Nancy S. Diehl</h2>
            <p>
              Nancy Diehl, a co-founder, is a native San Antonian who has shared the companionship of dogs and cats
              most of her life. Living in both other cities and other areas of San Antonio, she never quite realized the
              seriousness of the stray dog and feral cat situation in our fair city until she moved to King William.
              Despite the efforts of many caring residents, the number of animals in need is still very high. Nancy has
              helped to control many neighborhood feral colonies via the trap/neuter/return strategy, but much work lies
              ahead. She is pleased to lead The Cannoli Fund in this effort. A retired freelance editor and writer, Nancy
              lives in the craftsman bungalow that she and her late husband, Andy (an animal lover, as well), moved to in
              2003. She’s shared the house with rescue dogs, Margie,&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack, and Muppie, the cat who followed her
              home from the Riverwalk, Derby; and three outdoor community cats.

        <h2>Treasurer - Syeira Budd</h2>
        <p>
          Syeira Budd was born and raised on California’s Central Coast and moved to San Antonio in 2002. She has lived
          in an 1870s limestone house in Lavaca since 2005. Syeira is pleased to support the important work of The
          Cannoli Fund. Providing neighbors with the education and resources to spay and neuter animals is necessary to
          improve the health and safety of our cat and dog friends. Syeira enjoyed the companionship of many cats during
          childhood, including Ivan the First, Chauncey Buster Budd, Marmalade, and Earl Grey. Although her current
          landlord does not allow pets, she is a friend to dozens of cats and dogs in Lavaca and King William. Syeira
          returned to the board in summer 2015 after serving previously during The Cannoli Fund’s founding phase in
          2011-2012.

        <h2>Secretary - Suzanne Ohlmann</h2>
        <p>
          Suzanne Ohlmann has called Southtown home for over thirteen years. A writer, nurse, and musician, she lives
          with her husband, son, and a jubilee of adopted pets from the neighborhood, many of whom passed through the
          loving attention of The Cannoli Fund. Her role as secretary began shortly after the early summer of 2017 when,
          together with the Tenacious Diehl Women, she worked to trap, neuter, and return over forty cats on her block
          alone. From that throng of neutering and vaccination, her first official Cannoli adoption occurred, a
          mustachioed cat, Chapo, named for the narco kingpin himself, as the kitten had the same, clipped stache and
          was born underneath her neighbor’s porch, surely having emerged from the tunnels of El Chapo lore. Her current
          count of Cannoli family members includes a backyard feral group called The Junkyard Gang, three indoor tyrants
          lead by Chapo, her elder Westie, Fu ManChu, found at Taco Haven, and Manchego, a whippet-esque
          deer-horse-cat-dog who leaps and prances through their home as if driving Santa’s sleigh.

        <h2>Marley Diehl</h2>
        <p>
          Marley Diehl, a San Antonio native and co-founder of The Cannoli Fund, moved back to her hometown in 2005.
          Even though she grew up in another San Antonio neighborhood, her first childhood cat, a King William stray,
          was adopted as a kitten at the King William Fair in the 1980s. After being fortunate enough to be owned by
          some very sweet stray cats in Austin, Atlanta, and New Orleans, Marley became aware of the plight of urban
          feral cats. In her adult life, she’s been mom to five formerly stray dogs including a Bichon Frise/Dachshund
          mix teenager dumped with her puppies, to a Springer Spaniel with a broken leg rescued from euthanasia at ACS,
          to a tick-covered fluffy blonde puppy she found sitting in a busy intersection on the south side. Today she
          lives in King William with a tightly knit family of felines and a former Southtown stray Great Dane mix with
          heart issues. She cares for a small group of community cats and is a frequent kitten foster. A graphic
          designer, Marley developed and designed The Cannoli Fund’s logo and identity.
